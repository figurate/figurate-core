Figurate Discovery
==================

Discovery uses Multicast DNS to identify available services in the Figurate environment.

The benefits of discovery include:

 * No need to pre-configure endpoint host/port (discovery at runtime)
 * Simpler monitoring and health check dashboards that can discover services at runtime
 * A better way to scale server and server instances (no need to reconfigure IP addresses when spinning up new resources)
